## Temperature prediction
In this project I have tried to predict mean daily temperature for next 3 days for vilage where my parents live in Poland - TajÄ™cina
(prediction from single datapoint). Data gathered from: https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/ .
For now it have been done with linear regresion and simple Neural network, geting average prediciton error for 3 days with best models around ~2.16*C for LL and ~2.05*C for NN.

Models are learnt and verified on data of daily measurements between years 01.01.2015 and 31.12.2019.

The project is sapareted into parts:
- Data Analize
- Linear_regression prediction (Verification Error ~2.16*C)
- NN prediction (Verification Error ~2.05*C)
- LSTM prediciton (Verification Error ~1,95*C)

Data analize shall be run before prediction files to prepere the data.

Further description and conclusions of separete methods in jupyter-notebook files.

Currently workng on: get more data from different places on the map from api and predict temperature with better accuracy and longer period (5 days).

##### running the app:
* install jupyter-notebook on Venv or main python
* Run ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```
